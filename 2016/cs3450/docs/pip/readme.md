# Project Vegas - PIP

## Proposal 

> Create a cross platform, multiplayer card game engine which allows players to play both Crazy Eights & Hearts. The games will be playable in a player versus player and a player vs A.I. scenario. The project will implement a client side GUI through wxwidgets as well as server side request handling.
