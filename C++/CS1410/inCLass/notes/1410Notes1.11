1/11 Bubble Sort

Selection Sort
	- Like the bubble sort
	- Keeps track of the lowest value
	- Sorted on the left instead of on the right
	- 1 swap, n^2 comparisons

Algrithm Analysis
	- compare algrithms against another one.
	- define computational requirements
		- space and time
	- space (amount of memory consumed)
	- time (amount of time used)
	- Results might have problems based on hardware, OS, data
	- Ignore some constants
	- measure steps
		1. For loops running time * statements * nStatements

	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) // N
	{
		for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) // M
	}
	N*M

	- Big O is all about the growth rate
