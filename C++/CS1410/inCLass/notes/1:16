Pointer Arithmetic
	- we can do math on pointers to move them around.
	- + or - moves the size of whatever type in the array.
	- chock out sizeof()

Pointer initialization
	There is a special value in memory we like to set them to NULL

Pointer evaluation
	- You can evaluate pointer and de-referenced pointers

Pointers in Functions

Pointers can be returned

Pointers can be constants

Dynamic memory allocation
	- something you do if you don't know how big of an array you'll need
	- Dynamic allocation using the new operator
	int* pArrayPointer = new int[4];
	- you then use the delete operator when you're done with the memory
