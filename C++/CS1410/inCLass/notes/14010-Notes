1/9	Searching sorting and algorithm analysis

Linear search
	- Often called sequential
	- Searched one at a time
	- not very efficient (about n/2)

example:

int aArray[N];

	for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
	{
		if(aArray[i] == y)
		{
			return i;
		}
	}

Binary search
	- keep cutting the array in half
	- Ends up being log N faster
	- log base 2 of n

Bubble Sort
	- Loop over the data n-1 times
		if the current item is bigger than you swap it.
	- Forst loop guarantiees the last will be the biggest
	- Best N
	- Worst n^2
