Repo for my time at Utah State University

Mostly just assignments in classes.

## Freshman Year
**CS1400**  This was an introduction to C++ and primarily focused on coding basics (variables, loops, functions, etc).  
**CS1405**  This was a lab for 1400.  
**CS1410**  The second sememster of C++ focusing on things like pointers and sorting algorithms.  
**CS2410**  One of the required GUI classes done in C#.  
**MIS2100** Here we focused *heavily* on MS Excel, but we also did some HTML, CSS, and SQL.  

## Sophomore Year
**CS2420**  This is the third (and last) C++ class which concludes the "CS Core" focusing on algorithm analysis and more complex data structures.  
**CS3000**  Focuses on various topics the Dean deems important. While I was there we learned LaTex, Unix, and Vim.
